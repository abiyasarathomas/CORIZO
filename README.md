**Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning in Python**

Machine learning proves immensely helpful in many industries in automating tasks that earlier required human labor one such application of ML is predicting whether a particular trade will be profitable or not.

**Importing Libraries**
Python libraries make it very easy for us to handle the data and perform typical and complex tasks with a single line of code.

**Pandas** – This library helps to load the data frame in a 2D array format and has multiple functions to perform analysis tasks in one go.
**Numpy** – Numpy arrays are very fast and can perform large computations in a very short time.
**Matplotlib/Seaborn** – This library is used to draw visualizations.
**Sklearn** – This module contains multiple libraries having pre-implemented functions to perform tasks from data preprocessing to model development and evaluation.
**XGBoost** – This contains the eXtreme Gradient Boosting machine learning algorithm which is one of the algorithms which helps us to achieve high accuracy on predictions.


**CONCLUSION**

We can observe that the accuracy achieved by the state-of-the-art ML model is no better than simply guessing with a probability of 50%. Possible reasons for this may be the lack of data or using a very simple model to perform such a complex task as Stock Market prediction.
